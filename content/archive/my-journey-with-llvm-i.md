It has been one month since my proposal gets accepted by GSoC'20. I learned a lot and had a wonderful time. Besides, we’ve made some progress towards our goal. Hence, it’s a good time to review what I’ve done and what I’ve learned in the first coding period.

## The Project

In LLVM, we use `yaml2obj` to handcraft simple binaries of various formats in YAML, e.g., ELF, Mach-O, COFF, etc. My project is to add DWARF support to `yaml2obj` which hopefully makes it easier for people to handcraft debug sections in those kinds of binaries. This project is supervised by James Henderson.

## The Progress

We’ve already ported existing DWARF implementation to `yaml2elf` as planned. People are able to handcraft DWARF sections at a low level. I have to admit that the current implementation of DWARF sections is hard to use since we have to specify nearly every field of those sections, e.g., the length, the version, the address or offset of the associated DWARF section, etc. That’s because those sections are isolated in the current implementation and DWARFYAML lacks a strategy to make those sections get interlinked properly. This is what we are going to address and I believe it will be improved in the future. We also have a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qo5DWkBgSZjqVL6KlTXiV0kpUObuSlse7qDwn_WoXNE/edit?usp=sharing) to record the progress against the expected timeline.

## The Implementation Status

The supported DWARF sections’ syntax and known issues are listed below. I’m not going to resolve all of the issues since some DWARF sections are deprecated in DWARFv5 spec and rarely used.

> Note: The fields quoted by `[[]]` are optional.

### `debug_abbrev`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_abbrev:
  - [[Code: 1]]
    Tag: DW_CHILDREN_yes
    Attributes:
      - Attribute: DW_AT_producer
        Form: DW_FORM_strp
```

**Known Issues / Possible Improvements:**
- Doesn't support emitting multiple abbrev tables. ([D83116](https://reviews.llvm.org/D83116))

---

### `debug_addr`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_addr:
  - [[Format: DWARF32/DWARF64]]
    [[Length: 0x1234]]
    Version: 5
    [[AddressSize: 8]]
    [[SegmentSelectorSize: 0]]
    Entries:
      - Address: 0x1234
        [[Segment: 0x1234]]
```

**Known Issues / Possible Improvements:**
- `yaml2macho` doesn't support emitting the `.debug_addr` section.
- `dwarf2yaml` doesn't support parsing the `.debug_addr` section.

---

### `debug_aranges`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_aranges:
  - [[Format: DWARF32/DWARF64]]
    Length: 0x1234
    CuOffset: 0x1234
    AddrSize: 0x08
    SegSize: 0x00
    Descriptors:
      - Address: 0x1234
        Length: 0x00
```

**Known Issues / Possible Improvements:**
- The `Length`, `AddrSize` and `SegSize` fields should be optional.
- Rename `CuOffset` to `DebugInfoOffset`.
- Rename `AddrSize` to `AddressSize`.
- Rename `SegSize` to `SegmentSelectorSize`.

---

### `debug_info`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_info:
  - [[Format: DWARF32/DWARF64]]
    Length: 0x1234
    Version: 5
    UnitType: DW_UT_compile
    AbbrOffset: 0x00
    AddrSize: 0x08
    Entries:
      - AbbrCode: 1
        Values:
          - Value: 0x1234
          - BlockData: [ 0x12, 0x34 ]
          - CStr: 'abcd'
```

**Known Issues / Possible Improvements:**
- Rename `AbbrOffset` to `DebugAbbrevOffset`.
- Rename `AddrSize` to `AddressSize`.
- Rename `AbbrCode` to `AbbrevCode` or `Code`.

---

### `debug_line`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_line:
  - [[Format: DWARF32/DWARF64]]
    Length: 0x1234
    Version: 4
    PrologueLength: 0x1234
    MinInstLength: 1
    DefaultIsStmt: 1
    LineBase: 251
    LineRange: 14
    OpcodeBase: 3
    StandardOpcodeLengths: [ 0, 1, 1 ]
    IncludeDirs:
      - a.dir
    Files:
      - Name: hello.c
        DirIndex: 0
        ModTime: 0
        Length: 0
    Opcodes:
      - Opcode: DW_LNS_extended_op
        ExtLen: 9
        SubOpcode: DW_LNE_set_address
        Data: 0x1234
```

**Known Issues / Possible Improvements:**
- The DWARFv5 `.debug_line` section isn't tested.

---

### `debug_pub_names/types`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_pub_names/types:
  Length:
    TotalLength: 0xffffffff
    TotalLength64: 0x0c
  Version: 2
  UnitOffset: 0x1234
  UnitSize: 0x4321
  Entries:
    DieOffset: 0x1234
    Name: abcd
```

**Known Issues / Possible Improvements:**
- Doesn’t support emitting multiple pub tables.
- Replace `Length` with `Format` and `Length`.

---

### `debug_ranges`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_ranges:
  - AddrSize: 0x04
    Entries:
      - LowOffset: 0x10
        HighOffset: 0x20
```

---

### `debug_str`

**Syntax:**

```yaml
debug_str:
  - abc
  - def
```

## Accomplishments

I’m very happy that I’m roughly able to reach the goal of the first period. During the first coding period, I learned about how the debug information is represented at a lower level in object files and how to process errors in the LLVM library. I’m also able to dig into some related core libraries, such as DebugInfo, CodeGen, and so on.

## Areas in Need of Improvements

However, there are still some areas that I didn’t do well. When I was working on porting DWARF support to `yaml2elf`, I found that some DWARF sections were not well-formatted, e.g., the `.debug_pub*` sections don’t support emitting multiple pub tables, the `.debug_abbrev` section doesn’t support emitting multiple abbreviation tables, the `.debug_pub*` and `.debug_abbrev` sections lack terminating entries, etc. I used to port them to `yaml2elf` first and then try to fix the issue. However, it’s not the right approach! I should have fixed the issue first and then ported the section to `yaml2elf` so that I don’t have to update the test cases in many places and this prevents ill-formed test cases from spreading everywhere.

Besides, if I had made `elf2yaml` support converting DWARF sections back to YAML, my life would be easier. After porting some sections to `yaml2elf`, I realize that it’s good for us to have a tool that is able to convert DWARF sections back so that I don’t have to handcraft too many sections.
