My GSoC comes to an end and this is a report of my work during the last 3 months. My project is adding DWARF support to `yaml2obj`, especially `yaml2elf`. The original proposal is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wNr4JbXtzaOly-UsFt7vxI3LKXzik_lVU58ICqslWM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Implementation Status

With the help of my mentor James and other community members, I was able to accomplish most of the milestones in my original proposal. Now, the usability of the tool has been improved a lot. Some outstanding features are listed below.

**The `InitialLength` fields of DWARF sections are replaced with `Format` and `Length`.** At first, we have to hardcode the `InitialLength` field to instruct the tool to emit a proper DWARF64 or a DWARF32 section, e.g.,

```yaml
## DWARF32 section.
InitialLength:
  TotalLength32: 0x1234

## DWARF64 section.
InitialLength:
  TotalLength32: 0xffffffff
  TotalLength64: 0x1234
```

Now, `yaml2obj` emits DWARF32 sections by default and the `Length` field can be omitted, `yaml2obj` will calculate it for us (Patches that address this issue: [D82622](https://reviews.llvm.org/D82622), [D85880](https://reviews.llvm.org/D85880), [D81063](https://reviews.llvm.org/D81063), [D84008](https://reviews.llvm.org/D84008), [D86590](https://reviews.llvm.org/D86590), [D84911](https://reviews.llvm.org/D84911)).

```yaml
## DWARF32 section.
## The Format and Length fields can be omitted.
## We don't need to care about them.

## DWARF64 section.
Format: DWARF64 ## We only need to specify the Format field.
```

**`yaml2obj` supports emitting multiple abbrev tables.** `yaml2obj` only supported emitting a single abbrev table and multiple compilation units had to share the same abbrev table before [D86194](https://reviews.llvm.org/D86194) and [D83116](https://reviews.llvm.org/D83116). Now, `yaml2obj` is able to emit multiple abbrev tables and compilation units can be linked to any one of them. We add an optional field `ID` to abbrev tables and an optional field `AbbrevTableID` to compilation units. Compilation units can use `AbbrevTableID` to link the abbrev table with the same `ID`. However, the `AbbrOffset` field of compilation units which corresponds to the `debug_abbrev_offset` field still needs to be specified. If [D86614](https://reviews.llvm.org/D86614) can be accepted in the future, we don’t need to calculate it and specify it any more!

```yaml
debug_abbrev:
  - ID: 0
    Table:
      ...
  - ID: 1
    Table:
      ...
debug_info:
  - ...
    AbbrevTableID: 1 ## Reference the second abbrev table.
  - ...
    AbbrevTableID: 0 ## Reference the first abbrev table.
```

**More DWARF sections are supported.** The `debug_rnglists`, `debug_loclists`, `debug_addr` and `debug_str_offsets` sections are newly supported in `yaml2obj`. Check out [D83624](https://reviews.llvm.org/D83624), [D84234](https://reviews.llvm.org/D84234), [D81541](https://reviews.llvm.org/D81541) and [D83853](https://reviews.llvm.org/D83853) for more information!

**The DWARF support is added to `elf2yaml` and improved in `macho2yaml`.** At first, the output of `macho2yaml` is noisy. It dumps the DWARF sections twice, one in the `Sections:` entry and one in the `DWARF:` entry, e.g.,

```yaml
## The content of the debug_str section is dumped twice!
Sections:
  - sectname: __debug_str
    ...
    content: 6D61696E00 ## "main\0"
DWARF:
  debug_str:
    - main
```

After [D85506](https://reviews.llvm.org/D85506), if the DWARF parser fails to parse the DWARF sections into the `DWARF:` entry, `obj2yaml` will dump them as raw content sections, otherwise, they will be presented as structured DWARF sections in the `DWARF:` entry. Besides, [D85094](https://reviews.llvm.org/D85094) adds DWARF support to `elf2yaml`. Although it only supports dumping the `debug_aranges` section, we can easily extend it in the future.

## Unfinished Tasks

**Allow users to describe DIEs at a high level.** In my original proposal, we plan to make `yaml2obj` support describing DIEs at a high level. However, `yaml2obj` didn’t support emitting multiple abbrev tables at that time and I spent some time on enabling it to emit multiple abbrev tables and link compilation units with them. I’m not going to leave the community and I will improve it in the future.
